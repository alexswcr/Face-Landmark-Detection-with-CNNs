# Face-Landmark-Detection-with-CNNs

This repository contains the multiple python notebooks containing the code used to create CNN models to locate facial landmarks. Furthermore, the notebooks contain three different CNN models (they differ in number of feature layers and network) with the intention of comparing the performance of these models. This was done as part of my coursework for Applied Machine Learning (Year 2 Semester 2).
